     <h1> About Me </h1> 
    <p class="box">Hi, my name is Mary. I was born and raised in Spokane, WA. I am currently a second year student at Gonzaga University. I am majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance and Economics. 
    </p> I had intended to major in Biology in the hopes of becoming a doctor; however, things took a turn, and I realized that was no longer my desire. I am a firm believer that nothing in life is set in stone. Life is full of change, uncertainty, and growth—and rejection is redirection!</p>
    <h3>My Personal Motto</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, I am a firm believer that <strong>nothing in life is set in stone.</strong> Every day is an opportunity for growth and learning. Don’t let a moment of failure set you back; instead, view it as a valuable learning opportunity."</p>
<p> For example, during my first year, I failed Chemistry. At that time, I felt overwhelmed and thought the world was going to end, but it didn’t. I could have let that moment define me, but instead, I chose to transform that negative experience into something positive. I did some reflection and took that lesson with me. </p>
